# Hardklor parameter file
# Version 2.18, Release Date: Jan 26 2015
# Please see online documentation for detailed explanations: 
# https://code.google.com/p/hardklor/wiki/Documentation

# All parameters are separated from their values by an equals sign ('=')
# Anything after a '#' will be ignored for the remainder of the line.
# All data files (including paths if necessary) to be analyzed are discussed below.

# Parameters used to described the data being input to Hardklor
instrument	=	Orbitrap	#Values are: FTICR, Orbitrap, TOF, QIT
resolution	=	55000		#Resolution at 400 m/z
centroided	=	0		#0=no, 1=yes

# Parameters used in preprocessing spectra prior to analysis
ms_level		=	1		#1=MS1, 2=MS2, 3=MS3, 0=all
scan_range_min		=	0		#ignore any spectra lower than this number, 0=off
scan_range_max		=	0		#ignore any spectra higher than this number, 0=off
signal_to_noise		=	0		#set signal-to-noise ratio, 0=off
sn_window		=	250.0		#size in m/z for computing localized noise level in a spectrum.
static_sn		=	0		#0=off, 1=on. Apply lowest localized noise level to entire spectrum.
boxcar_averaging	=	0		#0=off, or specify number of scans to average together, use odd numbers only
boxcar_filter		=	0		#0=off, when using boxcar_averaging, only keep peaks seen in this number of scans
						#  currently being averaged together. When on, signal_to_noise is not used.
boxcar_filter_ppm	=	5		#Tolerance in ppm for matching peaks across spectra in boxcar_filter
mz_min			=	0		#Sets lower bound of spectrum m/z range to analyze, 0=off
mz_max			=	0		#Sets upper bound of spectrum m/z range to analyze, 0=off
smooth			=	0		#Performs Savitzky-Golay smoothing of peaks data. 0=off
						#  Not recommended for high resolution data.

# Parameters used to customize the Hardklor analysis. Some of these parameters will drastically
# affect the analysis speed and results. Please consult the documentation and choose carefully!
algorithm		=	Version2	#Algorithms include: Basic, Version1, Version2
charge_algorithm	=	Quick		#Preferred method for feature charge identification.
						#  Values are: Quick, FFT, Patterson, Senko, None
						#  If None is set, all charge states are assumed, slowing Hardklor
charge_min		=	1		#Lowest charge state allowed in the analysis.
charge_max		=	5		#Highest charge state allowed in the analysis.
correlation		=	0.95		#Correlation threshold to accept a peptide feature.
averagine_mod		=	0		#Formula containing modifications to the averagine model.
						#  Read documentation carefully before using! 0=off & clears all existing modifications.
mz_window		=	5.25		#Breaks spectrum into windows not larger than this value for Version1 algorithm.
sensitivity		=	3		#Values are 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest). Increasing sensitivity
						#  identifies more features near the noise where the isotope distribution
						#  may not be fully visible. However, these features are also more
						#  likely to be false.
depth			=	2		#Depth of combinatorial analysis. This is the maximum number of overlapping
						#  features allowed in any mz_window. Each increase requires exponential
						#  computation. In other words, keep this as low as necessary!!!
max_features		=	15		#Maximum number of potential features in an mz_window to combinatorially solve.
						#  Setting this too high results in wasted computation time trying to mix-and-match
						#  highly improbable features.

# Parameters used to customize the Hardklor output
distribution_area	=	0	#Report sum of distribution peaks instead of highest peak only. 0=off, 1=on
xml			=	0	#Output results as XML. 0=off, 1=on


# Below this point is where files to be analyzed should go. They should be contain both
# the input file name and the output file name. Each file to be analyzed should begin 
# on a new line. By convention Hardklor output should have this extension: .hk
# Example:
#YourData.mzXML YourData.hk
