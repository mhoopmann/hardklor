#summary Command line and parameters for Hardklor

= Command Line =

Hardkl√∂r is operated from the command line:

*Usage:* hardklor _<config file>_


_<config file>_ is an ASCII text file containing the parameters to use and the list of files to analyze. Detailed parameter descriptions are found below. An example configuration file can be found [SampleConfig here].


= Parameters =

|| *Parameter* || *Value* || *Recommended Range* || *Description* ||
|| algorithm || Text || Version2 || Possible algorithms to choose from: *Basic*, *Version1*, and *Version2*. This parameter determines which algorithm to use. Different results are possible with each algorithm, and there are pros and cons to each. The Basic algorithm performs unoptimized deconvolution and is provided for legacy purposes only. Version1 uses the optimizations developed during the version 1.0+ series. It is very accurate, but has limited sensitivity, and moderate speed improvements. Version2 uses the optimizations developed for version 2.0+. It is highly sensitive, but less accurate for very low abundance features, and performs exceptionally fast.||
|| averagine_mod || Text || 0 || Defines alternative averagine models in the analysis that incorporate additional atoms and/or isotopic enrichments. Modifications are represented as text strings. Inclusion of additional atoms in the model is done using by entering an atomic formula,such as: *PO2* or *Cl*. Inclusion of isotopic enrichment to the model is done by specifying the percent enrichment (as a decimal) followed by the atom being enriched and an index of the isotope. For example, *0.75H1* specifies 75% enrichment of the first heavy isotope of hydrogen. In other words, 75% deuterium enrichment. Two or more modifications can be combined into the same model, and separated by spaces: *B2 0.5B1* This parameter can also be listed multiple times in the configuration file to include multiple competing averagine models in a single analysis. Setting this parameter to *0* disables use of modifications in the analysis.||
|| boxcar_averaging || Integer || 0 || Boxcar averaging is a sliding window that averages _n_ adjacent spectra prior to feature detection. Averaging generally improves the signal-to-noise ratio of features in the spectra, as well as improving the shape of isotopic envelopes. However, averaging will also change the observed peak intensities. Averaging with too wide a window will increase the occurrence of overlapping features and broaden the chromatographic profiles of observed features. The number specified is the total adjacent scans to be combined, centered on the scan being analyzed. Therefore, an odd number is recommended to center the boxcar window. For example, a value of *3* would produce an average of the scan of interest, plus one scan on each side. A value of *0* disables boxcar averaging.||
